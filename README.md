## Description

This is a hello world action to test some features on Github Composite Actions.

## Tagging Workflow

As a GitHub user, it's generally better to apply tags on the target branch after merging the pull request. Here's the typical workflow:

1. **Create a feature branch**: When working on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the main development branch (often called "master" or "main").

2. **Commit changes**: Make your changes in the feature branch and commit them.

3. **Create a pull request**: Push your feature branch to the remote repository and create a pull request to merge it into the main development branch.

4. **Review and merge**: The pull request will go through a review process, where other developers can provide feedback and make suggestions. Once the changes are reviewed and approved, you can proceed with the merge.

5. **Merge pull request**: Merge the pull request into the main development branch (e.g., "master" or "main").

6. **Apply a tag**: After the pull request is successfully merged, apply a tag to mark the specific state of the code. Tags are usually used to indicate significant points in the repository's history, such as releases or milestones.

By tagging the merged commit, you ensure that the tag points to a stable version of the code that has undergone the review process and is considered a part of the project's development history. This way, anyone checking out the tag can expect a consistent and stable state of the codebase.

Keep in mind that this is just a common workflow, and different teams or projects may have variations based on their specific requirements. However, applying tags after merging pull requests is a common practice and aligns with the idea of tagging specific points in the development history of a project.
